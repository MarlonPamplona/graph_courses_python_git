examines the pre-diagnostic costs and health-seeking behavior of 880 new adult pulmonary tuberculosis
patients registered at Primary Health Centres (PHCs).*

```{python}
data = pd.read_csv("data/india_tb_pathways_and_costs.csv")

show(data)
```

### Map of Tamil Nadu

Chennai, the capital, is a major metropolitan and IT hub, while Coimbatore is known for textiles and industry. Madurai and Thanjavur are famous for ancient temples and cultural heritage. Tiruchirappalli (Trichy) is a key educational and industrial center, and Salem is known for steel production. Erode and Tiruppur lead in textiles, while **Vellore** is home to a historic fort and top medical institutions. The Nilgiris offer hill stations like Ooty, and Kanyakumari, at Indiaâ€™s southern tip, is known for its scenic coast. Agricultural districts like Thiruvarur, Nagapattinam, and Villupuram thrive on river-fed farming, while coastal districts such as Thoothukudi and Ramanathapuram support fisheries and trade.(Created using LLM)*

### Some Demographic Description

```{python}
median_age = int(data.Age.mean())
mean_wt = int(data.WtinKgs.mean())
mean_ht = int(data.HtinCms.mean())
mean_bmi = int(data.bmi.mean())
```
The median age of the study population is **`{python} median_age`**. The average height of the study population is **`{python} mean_wt`** kgs and the average weight is **`{python} mean_ht`** cm while the average bmi is **`{python} mean_bmi`**
